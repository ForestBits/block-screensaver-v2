This is a screensaver which shows "landscapes" made of blocks. Each landscape scrolls by before transitioning into the next landscape.

The landscapes themselves are procedurally generated through a scripting system. The generator files are written in Javascript. These scripts are then run by the engine using Chakra, the Microsoft Edge Javascript Engine.

The base idea was to have a scriptable screensaver. Everybody could mix and match what landscapes they wanted just by modifying what scripts are included. You could potentially have a website and marketplace where community creations are shared.

Javascript was chosen as it is a very popular (widespread) language, so many people already have the skills to script the screensaver.
